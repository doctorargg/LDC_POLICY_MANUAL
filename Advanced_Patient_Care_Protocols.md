## 1.2 Acute Care Management Protocols

2. **Risk Stratification:**
   - MRSA risk factors
   - Systemic symptoms
   - Immunocompromise
   - Failed outpatient treatment

#### Treatment Protocols
**Simple Abscess:**
- I&D procedure (see procedures section)
- No antibiotics if <2cm and no cellulitis
- Consider antibiotics if: multiple lesions, systemic symptoms, immunocompromised

**Cellulitis:**
- Non-purulent: Cephalexin 500mg QID x 5-7 days
- Purulent/MRSA risk: TMP-SMX DS BID + cephalexin
- Mark borders, follow-up in 48-72 hours

**CPT Codes:**
