# Controlled Substance Logging Requirements Research

## Wisconsin State Requirements (Med 17.05)

### Recordkeeping Requirements for Controlled Substances

#### General Requirements
- Records required by federal controlled substances act and ch. 961, Stats., shall be maintained at the location where the drug is received, distributed or dispensed
- Records must be available for inspection by authorized persons for at least **5 years** from the date of such record

#### Specific Logging Requirements for Dispensed Controlled Substances
Controlled substances dispensed by a practitioner must be recorded:

1. **In Patient Record**: As provided in the general section
2. **In Separate Log Book**: On a separate log, in a separate bound log book where each schedule of controlled substances dispensed is recorded separately and in chronological order

#### Required Information in Controlled Substance Log
The separate bound log book must contain the following information for each controlled substance dispensed:

a. **The name of the substance**
b. **Dosage form and strength of the substance**
c. **Name and address of the person for whom dispensed**
d. **Date of dispensing**
e. **Quantity dispensed**
f. **Name or initials of practitioner who dispensed the substance**

#### Key Compliance Points
- Each schedule of controlled substances must be recorded **separately**
- Entries must be in **chronological order**
- Must use a **bound log book** (not loose sheets)
- Records must be maintained for **minimum 5 years**
- Records must be available for inspection by authorized persons
- Must maintain complete and accurate records of each controlled substance received, dispensed, or disposed of

## Federal DEA Requirements

### Basic Requirements from DEA Research
- DEA registration required for handling controlled substances
- Complete inventory of controlled substances required at least every two years
- Biennial controlled substance inventory log required
- Must follow federal controlled substances act requirements
- Records must be maintained at location where substances are stored/dispensed

### Ketamine-Specific Considerations
- Ketamine is a Schedule III controlled substance
- Requires DEA registration for administration
- Must follow all Schedule III logging and inventory requirements
- Special considerations for clinical administration vs. research use


## Ketamine-Specific Requirements

### Schedule III Classification
- Ketamine became a Schedule III non-narcotic substance under the Controlled Substances Act in 1999
- Same classification as anabolic steroids and low-dose codeine products
- Currently accepted medical use with moderate to low physical dependence potential

### Clinical Administration Requirements
- DEA registration required for practitioners administering ketamine
- Must follow all Schedule III controlled substance protocols
- Patient safety considerations: no driving or hazardous activities for up to 24 hours post-administration
- Requires appropriate medical supervision and monitoring

### Documentation Requirements for Ketamine Administration
Based on Schedule III requirements:
- Must maintain perpetual inventory
- Record all receipts, administration, and disposal
- Separate logging for each administration
- Patient-specific documentation in medical records
- Biennial inventory requirements

## Best Practices for Clinical Controlled Substance Logging

### Daily Logging Protocol
1. **Pre-Administration Check**
   - Verify current inventory count
   - Document pre-administration amount
   - Confirm patient identity and authorization

2. **Administration Documentation**
   - Date and time of administration
   - Patient name and identifier
   - Substance name, strength, and amount administered
   - Route of administration
   - Prescribing/administering practitioner
   - Witness signature (if required)

3. **Post-Administration**
   - Document remaining inventory
   - Note any waste or unused portions
   - Update perpetual inventory log

### Security and Storage Requirements
- Secure storage in locked cabinet or safe
- Limited access to authorized personnel only
- Separate storage from non-controlled substances
- Environmental controls (temperature, humidity)
- Regular inventory audits

### Disposal and Waste Management
- Document all waste and disposal
- Follow DEA guidelines for controlled substance disposal
- Witness requirements for waste disposal
- Maintain disposal records for required retention period
