# Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy Research Findings

## Key Guidelines from PMC Article (2024)

### Overview
- Ketamine efficacy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is well documented
- Growing interest in incorporating ketamine into psychiatry across diverse settings
- Transition from research/specialist settings to routine clinical practice poses significant challenges

### Ketamine Formulations
- **Racemic Ketamine**: Mixture of equal amounts of (S)- and (R)-ketamine (esketamine and arketamine)
- **Esketamine Nasal Spray**: Licensed for TRD in combination with conventional antidepressant in Europe and New Zealand
- **Off-label Racemic Ketamine**: Increasing use as cost-efficient approach

### Administration Routes
1. **Intravenous (IV)**: Gold standard for off-label use with best supporting evidence
2. **Intramuscular (IM)**: Being explored but requires further research
3. **Subcutaneous**: Requires further validation
4. **Oral**: Limited evidence, requires more research
5. **Sublingual**: Being explored
6. **Intranasal Esketamine**: Licensed option with proven efficacy

### Key Safety Concerns
- **Psychiatric Effects**: Dissociation, psychotomimetic effects, increased suicidality
- **Neurological/Cognitive Effects**: Require monitoring
- **Genitourinary Effects**: Need assessment
- **Hemodynamic Effects**: Blood pressure and heart rate monitoring required

### Treatment Environment Requirements
- Multidisciplinary personnel required
- Experts in mood disorder assessment needed
- Appropriate monitoring equipment and protocols
- Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies

### Efficacy Timeline
- Rapid-onset efficacy within 1-2 days
- Best established for intranasal esketamine and IV ketamine
- Intranasal esketamine proven effective for up to 1 year
- Long-term effects of IV ketamine insufficiently studied

### Monitoring Requirements
- Systematic monitoring using tools like Ketamine Side Effect Tool
- Assessment of mood and cognitive function
- Regular evaluation of clinical responses
- Diligent oversight in ketamine therapy clinics



## APNA Ketamine Treatment Checklist Key Points

### State Scope of Practice Requirements
- Review applicable state nursing, medical, drug and facility statutes and regulations
- Verify state board of nursing opinions applicable to RNs and/or APRNs
- Consult Scope of Nursing Practice Decision-Making Framework when in doubt

### Treatment Recommendations (Appropriate Candidates)
- Adults with moderate to severe depression
- Adults experiencing acute suicidality
- Individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder (with managed mood stabilization)
- Individuals diagnosed with personality disorders (provided individual can manage infusions and engage in therapy)

### Candidate Eligibility Considerations
- IV ketamine therapy should NOT be considered for initial treatment
- Should only be considered after failure of standard treatment:
  - No sustained change following adequate antidepressant trials
