## Key Databases and Search Strategies

### PubMed Search Optimization

**DPC-Specific Searches:**
```
("direct primary care"[All Fields] OR "direct care"[All Fields]) 
AND ("practice management"[MeSH] OR "quality improvement"[MeSH])
Filters: Last 5 years, English
```

**Functional Medicine Searches:**
```
("functional medicine"[All Fields] OR "integrative medicine"[MeSH]) 
AND ("evidence-based practice"[MeSH] OR "clinical protocols"[All Fields])
Filters: Systematic Reviews, Meta-analyses
```

**Mental Health Integration:**
```
("primary care"[MeSH] AND "mental health services"[MeSH]) 
AND ("integrated care"[All Fields] OR "collaborative care"[All Fields])
Filters: Clinical Trials, Guidelines
```

### Alert Setup Recommendations

**Weekly Alerts:**
- Direct primary care + innovation
- Ketamine therapy + primary care
- Functional medicine + evidence
- Mental health + primary care integration

**Monthly Alerts:**
- Practice management + direct care
- Quality metrics + primary care
- Patient engagement + DPC
- Technology + primary care
