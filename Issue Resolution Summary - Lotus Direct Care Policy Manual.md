# Issue Resolution Summary - Lotus Direct Care Policy Manual

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Content Leakage Issue ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Ketamine protocols content was appearing on the main dashboard page
**Root Cause**: Orphaned HTML content (lines 1075-1170) sitting outside of proper section containers
**Solution**: Removed the orphaned content that was duplicated and improperly placed
**Result**: Main dashboard page now displays only appropriate dashboard content

### 2. Logo Display Issue ✅ RESOLVED  
**Problem**: Lotus flower logo not appearing properly in header
**Root Cause**: Logo was too small (h-8 w-8) and had poor HTML structure
**Solution**: 
- Increased logo size to h-10 w-10 (40x40 pixels)
- Improved HTML structure by separating logo image from text
- Better layout with proper spacing and alignment
**Result**: Logo now displays clearly and prominently in header
