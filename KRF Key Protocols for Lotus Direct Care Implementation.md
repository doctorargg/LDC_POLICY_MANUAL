# KRF Key Protocols for Lotus Direct Care Implementation

## Core KRF Principles for Clinical Practice

### 1. Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) Standard of Care
**KRF Position**: Ketamine should be administered as part of comprehensive psychotherapy, not merely as a drug treatment.

**Key Requirements for Lotus Direct Care:**
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Complete evaluation including substance history, trauma history, relationship history, social/family situations, work/financial status
- **In-Person Preparatory Meetings**: Build trust and familiarity before treatment
- **Integration Focus**: Essential component - processing the experience, sharing, and incorporating insights
- **Minimum Session Duration**: 2-3 hours minimum stay required
- **Recovery Space**: Quiet space for post-session recovery mandatory

### 2. Clinical Administration Protocols

#### Routes of Administration (KRF Guidelines)
**Primary Methods:**
- **Intravenous (IV)**: 40-60 minute drip, full absorption, onset gradual
- **Intramuscular (IM)**: 2-3 minute onset, rapid peak, 2-3 injections common
- **Oral-Buccal (Lozenges/RDTs)**: Requires proper "swishing" technique, saliva retention critical
- **Intranasal**: Including Spravato (esketamine)

**Critical KRF Teaching**: Lozenges/RDTs are delivery vehicles - the saliva containing ketamine must be retained and circulated in mouth for proper absorption.

#### Session Components (KRF Standard)
**Essential Elements:**
1. **Opening Period**: Frame work, create connection, review stresses, prepare for medication
2. **Ketamine Experience**: Monitored administration with supportive presence
3. **Integration**: Process experience, discuss impact/meaning, address difficulties, prepare for going home

**Setting Requirements:**
- Music, comfort, reclining chairs, eyeshades
- Office setting conducive to relaxation
- Atmosphere suggesting warmth and compassion

### 3. Safety and Monitoring Requirements

#### Practitioner Requirements (KRF Standards)
- **Personal Familiarity**: Practitioners should have personal experience with ketamine to understand patient experience
- **Comprehensive Training**: Understanding of psychedelic medicine principles
- **Therapeutic Presence**: Warmth, attention, and openness are critical success factors
- **Extended Availability**: Must sit with patients as long as necessary for recovery

#### Patient Safety Protocols
- **No Early Release**: Patients must not be sent home until safe for release
- **Transportation**: Rides and supportive persons preferred
- **Follow-up Integration**: Sessions should occur within days of ketamine session
- **Medical Monitoring**: Based on route of administration and patient factors

### 4. Treatment Planning and Assessment

#### Comprehensive Evaluation Requirements
**Must Include:**
- Complete medical and psychiatric history
- Substance use history and current status
- Trauma history assessment
- Relationship and social history
- Current life stressors and support systems
- Financial and insurance considerations
- Previous psychotherapy experience

#### Informed Consent Process
- **Meticulous Process**: Thorough discussion of risks, benefits, alternatives
- **Treatment Plan**: Initial plan created and discussed
- **Flexibility**: Acknowledge limited ability to predict exact course
- **Family Involvement**: For adolescents, family therapy component required

### 5. KRF Differentiation from "Drug-Only" Approaches

#### What KRF Opposes:
- **Mail-Order Distribution**: Unsupported ketamine distribution
- **Medicalized-Only Clinics**: IV clinics without psychotherapy support
- **Anesthesiologist-Only Models**: Without psychiatric/psychotherapy training

#### KRF Success Rates:
- **Drug-Only Approach**: ~30% remission rate for Treatment Resistant Depression
- **Full KAP Approach**: Much higher success rate when practiced to full standard of care
